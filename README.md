# OpenSCAD radiator generator for tablet like divices

I was inspired by astonishing engineering stupidity of Lenovo Miix 320 developers.
They put really hot CPU in this hybrid notebook and covered it with plastic case.
Throttling is used to to prevent overheat and drops CPU performance down to 30% of original value.

When physics of real world comes into play it occurs that plastic cover 
and air gap between copper plate over CPU and tablet case are not really good
conditions for cooling.
As a result on any significant load CPU lost about 70% of it performance 
and can be locked into such state for a long time.

For me solution is obvious - do anything possible to please his majesty Physics.
We have to move heat away from CPU as quick as possible. 
This also implies that heat should be redistributed along wide surface to avoid hot spots.

This can be done by replacing part of plastic cover with aluminum radiator.
Yes you should cut of aperture in plastic and put radiator there.

## Here is how it looks like

This radiator model is customizable. 
You can adjust wight, height, thickness, number of radiator ribs and many more other features.

## Not only for Lenovo tablets

I think that this radiator can be used with any similar device with plastic case and hot CPU.
